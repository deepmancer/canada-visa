\section*{Why do you wish to study in Canada?}

Canada stands out as an ideal destination for my graduate studies due to its globally recognized universities, strong research programs, and supportive environment for international students. In particular, Canadian institutions excel in computer science, offering thesis-based master's programs that align perfectly with my research interests and long-term goals. The country's commitment to diversity and inclusion, along with generous government scholarships and financial aid, makes higher education both accessible and rewarding for international students like myself. Furthermore, the fact that English is the primary language adds to the appeal, as it allows me to fully engage in academic and research activities without language barriers.

I also considered similar programs in the USA, UK, and Europe; however, I found that Canada's master's programs align more closely with my academic goals. In some of these regions, programs may be shorter or more coursework-focused, which would limit the depth of research I seek. Additionally, funding opportunities for international students are often more restrictive elsewhere, making those options less feasible. Moreover, in countries where English is not the primary language, participation in both academic and social environments could be more challenging. While each country offers unique strengths, I found that only Canada meets all these criteria while offering a well-aligned program at a reputable institution.
